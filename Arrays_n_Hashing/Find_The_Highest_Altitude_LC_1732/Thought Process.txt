Find_The_Highest_Altitude_LC_1732
We are provided with an array, we have to find the commulative sum of the array and then
we have to check the highest value in there.

for commulative sum we can use
            a loop to find commulative sum mannualy
            the itertools to find the commulative sum automatically.
            the better option is the loop one where space complexity is O(1)

max_func:
    we can use array.max function to get the highest value
    Time complexity : O(n)
    Space Complexity : O(1)

iter_tools:
    we can use itertools(arr, max) to get the max value of the array
    Time complexity : O(n)
    Space Complexity: O(n)

sorting:
    we can sort the array with nlogn time and pick the last element
    Time complexity : O(nlogn)
    Space Complexity : O(1)

manual:
    we can mannualy go through the whole loop picking up the highest value as we go on and 
    return that
    time complexity: O(n)
    Space complexity : O(1)

For these solutions we need to pair all these solutions with the loop used for commulative sum.
increasing the complexity.

What we can do is to use a single loop and use that for commulation and while going through that
we keep track of the highest value as well
time complexity:O(n)
space complexity:O(1)


Edge cases:
    the numbers are all -ve
    the arr is empty
    the numbers are all same
    the numbers are too many
    the numbers are all 0
