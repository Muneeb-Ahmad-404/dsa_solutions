Find_The_Difference_of_Two_Arrays_LC_2215
we are provided with two arrays. we have to return an array with characters of first array that
are not present in the second array(list)

bruteforce:
    we run a loop over the first list and check if the char is present in the next or not, if absent
    add it to the result array else not.

    time complexity:O(n*m)
    space complexity:O(n+m)

hash_solution:
    we run a loop over the second array and store values as char, 1 pair in a hash.
    1 is for the presence of a character   
    now run a loop over the first array and for each element if hash[element] == 0 we add it to the result
    array.(for defaultdict--and for normal dict check if the element is present if not then add to the result)
    else continue to the next iteration

    time complexity:O(n+m)
    space complexity:O(n+m)


    or we can make sets for both sets and return the difference of the lists as (list(set1-set2), list(set2-set))

Edge cases:
    both arrays are empty
    are too short
    one of the arrays is empty
    arrays are too long
    arrays are anagrams
    arrays have all chars distinct
