We are provided with an array of numbers
we need to find pairs of indices i and j where i<j and arr[i] == arr[j]
and then we need to return the number of those pairs

Brute Force:
    we use two iterators i and j where i is at start and j at end.
    i can go from 0 to len arr
    and j can go fron i+1 to len arr.
    when arr[i] == arr[j] we increment

    time complexity :O(n^2)
    space complexity: O(1)

Hash approach:
    add all the values to a hash as hash[number] = count
    after that we need to traverse the hash
    and for each key we use the value as (count-1+count-2+count-3...0)

    time complexity : O(n)
    space complexity : O(n)
