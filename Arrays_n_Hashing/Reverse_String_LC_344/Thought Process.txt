We are being provided with a list of strings and we have to develop an inplace solution
to reverse the list.

Loop:
    Run a loop with iterators i and j at start and end of list
    replace the i and j placed elements.
    and do this till i<j
    time complexity: O(n)
    inplace

Recursion
    time complexity: O(n)
    space complexity: O(n)

Edge cases:
    the list is empty
    the list is too large
    the list is anagram
    the list has one element
    the list have same elements
