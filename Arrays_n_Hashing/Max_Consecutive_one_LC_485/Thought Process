We are provided with an array with binary values 0 or 1
we need to find the most number of 1's present consecutively and return it

Brute force: (true = make all possible sublists and check which contains all 1's and is largest)
    initialize a max count var
    We iterate over the nums
    use another counter lets say m
    when we face a 1 we increment m
    when we face a 0 we update count as max(count, m) do this once after the loop as well
    and m = 0
    after the loop we return max.

    time complexity: O(n) not truly brute force
    space complexity: O(1)

    or we can track zeroes and there indices and after all the traversal we find the difference
    btw consecutive indices max of those differences is our answer.

test_cases:
    the array could be empty
    array could be too short
    could be too long
    could have all ones
    could have no ones
