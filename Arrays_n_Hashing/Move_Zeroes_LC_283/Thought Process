We have been provided with a list of numbers
we need to put all the zeroes from the list to the end (they cant be between nonzero numbers)
the relative order should still be maintained

Brute Force:
    we run a loop we count the number of zeroes while removing them aswell.
    after counting zeroes run a loop on the count and add zeroes at end

    or 
    we can run a loop and whenver we face a zero we remove it from the index and add it to the end

    time complexity: O(n^2) list.remove() takes n  time.
    space complexity: O(1)

Better:
    A better solution would be to create an empty list
    run a loop over the given list
    whenever  we face a nonzero we add that to the list
    and when its a zero we take that into account (use a variable to count)
    then after the loop at the number of zeros at the end

    time complexity: O(n)
    space complexity: O(n)
