Sentence_is_Pangram_LC_1832
a pangram is a sentence containing every alphabet atleast once.

bruteforce:
    a brute force solution would be to search the sentence for each of the english 
    alphabet.
    time complexity:O(26*n)
    space complexity:O(1)

set/hash:
    for a set add all the chars of the sentence to the set.
    if the length of the set is equal to the number of alphabets then yes its panagram

    or use a hash and after mapping all he chars check the length of the hash

    time complexity:O(n)
    space complexity:O(26)
