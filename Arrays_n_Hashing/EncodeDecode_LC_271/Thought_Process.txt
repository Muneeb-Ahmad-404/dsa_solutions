I would be provided with a list of strings. I have to encode it to a single strings and 
then decode the single to the list again.

I can simply add all the list to a single string and save the length of individual strings for 
encoding. And use that combined string and the list of lengths for decoding.

Problem: The strings can have numbers too, how to differ between length and string numbers?
Solution Add something that cannot be in the list as a divider lets say '#'
Well # can be in the list but if we put it with the length at the start we can skip going through
the actual strings we can jump places from one length to the next.....


Edge cases:
        the string list could be empty
        a string could be of length 1
        a string could be empty among the list
        what if the length is greater then 9 (2 digit or 3 or even more)
        .......(its all the same i guess)
