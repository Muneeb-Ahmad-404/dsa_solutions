we are provided with a list and we need to return a list that is a concatenation of two provided lists
[provided]  result = [provided, provided]

Brute force:
    we can declared an empty array twice the size of the provided one
    run a loop over the provided one 
    and for add arr[i] at result[i] and result[i+n] for all values of i where n is the lenght of the given array.
    time complexity:O(n)
    space:O(n) required.

Better:
    we can use nums * 2 and python stuff etc
    time complexity: O(n)
