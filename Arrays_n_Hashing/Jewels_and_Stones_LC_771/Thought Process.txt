Jewels_and_Stones_LC_771
We are given a string named jewels and a string names stones.
each charachter in jewels represent a jewel.
and each charachter in stones represent a stone.
we need to identify the jewels in the stones. and return the count.
Also the charachters are case sensitive

Brute_force(can use str.counter):
    run a loop over the stones and for each charachter or part of the string
    check if the charachter is present in the jewels.
    if present append the count by one else move next

    time complexity: O(n^2)
    space complexity: O(1)


Hashmap(-an inbuilt option using collections.counter):
    Use a hashmap and run a loop over the jewels.
    for each jewel or charachter save it as a key and the value is zero.
    Then run a loop over stones and check if present in the jewel_hash append
    the count
    at the end add all the counts and return answer.

    time complexity: O(n+m)
    space complexity: O(m)



edge cases:
    the stones string is empty
    the jewels string is empty
    both strings are empty
    there is no jewel
    all the stones are jewels
    there are too many stones
    there are too many jewels
