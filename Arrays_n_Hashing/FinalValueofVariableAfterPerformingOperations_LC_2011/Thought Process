We are give a list of strings, each string contains pre, post increment and pre, post decrement.
We need to have variable with initial value 0. Now based on those strings, the increment of decrement
we apply the operation to that variable and after the whole list is traversed 
return the variable

Solution:   
    We can run a loop through the entire list and for each loop check if eithert the first or last value of the string is + or -. based on what we get perform the operation on the variable
    time complexity : O(n)
    space complexity : O(1)

Edge cases: 
    list is empty
    list is too large
    list has all decrements
    list has all increments
    these test cases are not going to occur as the question explicitly states it.
    the given array does not follow the pattern
    the given array has string smaller then size 3
