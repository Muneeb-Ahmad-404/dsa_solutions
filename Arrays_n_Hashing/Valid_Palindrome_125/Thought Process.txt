Valid_Palindrome_125
we have been provided with a string. we have to  check if it is a palindrome or not
a palindrome is a string for which after ignoring spaces and symbols other than alphabets, if
it reads same forward and backwards uppercase are converted to lower case

Brute force:
    a brute force would be to create a new array and then add only the elements that are alphabet to it
    while converting them to lowerr case or converting them after the first addition.
    then comparing the starting and ending elements like in the two pointer approach

    time complexity: O(n)
    space complexity: O(n)


Two pointer
    Run a loop over the given string with two pointers from start and from end.
    if the start element or lets say left element is not an alphabet we move the left pointer ahead
    if the right element is a symbol other then alphabets we move it backwards.
    now when both are alphabets we compare them if they are same we iterate both i and j.
    if different we return false.
    then after i<j condition is true we return True.

    time complexity: O(n)
    space complexity: O(1)

    Edge cases:

    the string is empty
    the string is too large 
    the string has all alphanumeric chars
    the string has no alphanumeric chars
    the string has the same charachter
