We are provided with a string and we have to return a string
the returned string should have its vowel elements reversed. first vowel with last and 2nd with 2nd last and so on.


two pointers:
    convert the string to a list
    now use two pointers one at the end and one at start.
    for the consonants keep adding from the left and for the vowels search from vowel at the end and swap them
    and voila you got the reversed vowels

    time complexity:O(n)
    space complexity: O(1)

edge cases:
    the string could be empty
    it might have no vowels
    it might have no consonants
    it might be too long with no vowels
    it might be too long with all vowels
