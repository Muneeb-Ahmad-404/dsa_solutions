We have been provided with a list of numbers and we have to return a list of those numbers squared
in sorted form.

Brute Force:
    We need to run a loop over the list provided, squaring each value.
    Then we can sort that using function sort().
    time complexity : O(nlogn)
    space complexity :O(1)

two-pointer:
    we place two pointers lets say i on start of list and j on the end.
    we square both i and j elements
    then compare if i > j then i is placed at j's position

Understanding
    [-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  [0, 1, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
      i                 j                      k  j chosen   max(i^2, j^2)
      i              j                      k     j chosen      
      i            j                      k       j chosen
      i        j                       k          j chosen
      i     j                       k             j
      i  j                       k                i
         ij                  k                    0

    time complexity: O(n) as we have to run a single loop only
    space : O(n)     as we have to create another array to store our result


Test cases:
    array may be empty
    all the numbers can be -ve 
    arrays are too long
