We have been provided an array. the array is divided in to to parts each of n length(n is provided)
lets say the left part is x part and right part is y.
we have to return an array where the elements should be as x1, y1, x2, y2, and so on

brute_force:
    we make an empty list
    we can use i and j iterators in a loopp
    the i will start from 0 to n-1 and j will start from n to 2n-1
    we will populate the new list by using list.append(arr[i]), list.append(arr[j])

time complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

This is the best we are gonna get

Edgecases:
    list is empty
    list is too large
    list contains same elements
    list contains negative elements.
    etc
