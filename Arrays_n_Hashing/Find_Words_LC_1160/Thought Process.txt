Find_Words_LC_1160
We are provided with a list of strings or words and a string.
for each word in the list we need to check if it can be formed by the string characters by using each
character only once in whatever sequence.
For the words which can be formed by the given string we need to return the sum of there lenght.

Brute force:    
    run a loop over the list of words.
    for each word run a loop over each char and check if that char exists in the
    given string. if yes add that index to sum sort of list as memo that its not to be checked again.
    now for the words where we have covered the whole length of the word. add its lenght to a variable.

    keep doing that for each word and return the length variable
    time complexity:O(n*w*m) n is number of words in the list w is number of chars of each word
    and m is number of chars in the string given
    space complexity:O(m)

Hash solution:
    make a hash for the given string where each char is mapped with its count
    now run a loop over words.
    now for each word make a hash and compare it with the first hash, if they match
    then add the length if not move to the next.
    time complexity:O(m+n)
    space complexity:O(m+n)
