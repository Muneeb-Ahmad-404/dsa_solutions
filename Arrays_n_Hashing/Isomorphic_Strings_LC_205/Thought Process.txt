We are provided with two strings and we have to check if the two strings are isomorphic
two strings are isomorphic if the character from unique characters from first string can be mapped
by the unique charachters of the second string.

Example 1:

Input: s = "egg", t = "add"

Output: true

Explanation:

The strings s and t can be made identical by:

Mapping 'e' to 'a'.
Mapping 'g' to 'd'.
Example 2:

Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"

Output: false

Explanation:

The strings s and t can not be made identical as 'o' needs to be mapped to both 'a' and 'r'.

Example 3:

Input: s = "paper", t = "title"

Output: true

 

Hash: we iterate over both strings at the same time.
    for each iteration we use the char from first string as key and the second as value
    if for a key a value exist and is different from what we are trying to put then we return false
    else after the for loop we return true
    similar is done by considering the second array as first and the first array as second(reversing positons)
