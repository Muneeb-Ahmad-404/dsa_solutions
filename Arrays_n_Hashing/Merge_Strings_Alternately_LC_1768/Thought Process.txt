Merge_Strings_Alternately_LC_1768
We are porvided with to strings and we need to create a string where we add the 
charachters from both strings one by one alternately like a1,b1,a2,b2 and so on where a and b are the strings

Brute force:
    create a string. run a loop for the len of strings.
    for each iteration first add the char from one string and then from the other to the new string.

    at the end of loop we have our string required

    time complexity : O(n)
    space complexity: O(n)

edge cases:
    the strings could be same
    the strings could be both empty
    one of the strings could be empty
    strings could be too long
    strings could be of 1 charachter
    one string has one charachter and the other has many
