Fizz_Buzz_LC_412
We are given a number n and we have to return a list of strings
the list is 1-indexed and the for index i divisible by 3 the value is Fizz, when it is only divisible by 5 the 
value is Buzz and if it is divisible by both the value is FizzBuzz and for all other cases the value is the 
index.

Loop;
    we run a loop from 1 to n
    for each value of i we check for if it is divisible by 3, by 5, by both or none and assign values

    time complexity: O(n)
    space complexity: O(n)

Edge cases;
    n is negative:
    n is too small
    n is zero
    n is too large
