This repository documents my ongoing learning journey in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), featuring structured problem-solving approaches, detailed thought processes, and optimized solutions for various coding challenges.

# üöÄ Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Solutions & Learning Journey üí°

Welcome to my comprehensive repository documenting my deep dive into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)! This space serves as a meticulously organized collection of problems I've solved, reflecting a structured learning approach focused on mastering fundamental concepts, optimizing solutions, and articulating my thought process for technical interviews and competitive programming.

## ‚ú® **About This Repository**

This repository is a testament to my commitment to building a robust foundation in computer science fundamentals. It covers a wide array of DSA topics, with each problem demonstrating:
* A clear understanding of the problem statement.
* An articulated thought process, often exploring brute-force ideas to optimized solutions.
* Efficient and well-commented code implementations.
* Thorough complexity analysis (Time and Space).

My goal is not just to solve problems, but to **understand the 'why' and the 'how'** behind each solution, preparing for challenging technical roles in the software industry.

## üó∫Ô∏è **Learning Path & Resources**

This journey is heavily inspired by and complements my learning from:

* **Princeton University's Algorithms Course (Parts I & II):** Providing rigorous theoretical understanding and mathematical foundations.
* **NeetCode.io's Roadmaps (e.g., NeetCode 150):** Guiding problem selection and offering excellent insights into common interview patterns and articulation techniques.
* **LeetCode.com:** The primary platform for hands-on problem-solving practice and verification.

## üìÇ **Repository Structure**

The solutions are organized logically to facilitate easy navigation:

* **`./<Topic_Name>/`**: Top-level folders categorize problems by major DSA concepts (e.g., `Arrays`, `Trees`, `Graphs`, `Dynamic_Programming`).
* **`./<Topic_Name>/<Subtopic_Name>/`**: (Optional) For very broad topics, subfolders may be used to further categorize problems (e.g., `Trees/Binary_Search_Trees`).
* **`./<Problem_Name_Platform_ID>/`**: Each problem has its own dedicated folder, named clearly with the problem's title, originating platform (e.g., LeetCode), and ID (if applicable).
    * **`README.md`**: Inside each problem folder, a detailed `README.md` provides the problem statement, example, **my step-by-step thought process (interview style)**, approach chosen, code, and complexity analysis.
    * **Code Files**: Solution files (e.g., `solution.py`, `solution_optimal.java`) for different approaches or languages.
